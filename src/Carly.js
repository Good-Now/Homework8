<p>After multi-platinum Grammy, Juno and Polaris Prize nominated singer/songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen released her critically acclaimed album E·MO·TION in 2015, it became “a modern touchstone for a new crop of pop-leaning artists and legacy acts,” as NPR noted. The album also inspired an abundance of memes — extending the cultural cachet that Jepsen earned from the ubiquity of her GRAMMY® -nominated blockbuster hit “Call Me Maybe” (from her U.S debut album Kiss), which not only climbed to No. 1 on the iTunes Singles charts in over 47 countries, sold over 20 million singles worldwide, and was certified Diamond in the U.S., but was referenced by everyone from former secretary-of-state Colin Powell to Cookie Monster.</p>
<p>Jepsen’s 2019 album Dedicated, retains the joyful, hook-filled feeling of its predecessor. But where E*MO*TION was an ’80s-influenced synth-pop classic that Rolling Stone called “a pop masterclass” and Stereogum called “indisputable, unfuckwithable pop genius,” Dedicated has a more ’70s-inspired feel at times, though the album defies categorization as a whole, with Vulture stating, “Dedicated is both stranger and freer than the last record, but it also feels more confident and considered.” Working with a crew of trusted songwriters and producers, among them John Hill, Jack Antonoff, Captain Cuts, Patrik Berger, and her longtime collaborator Tavish Crowe, Jepsen indulged in more sonic experimentation than she had in the past.</p>
