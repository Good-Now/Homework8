<h2>A.G. Cook</h2>
<img src={ag} alt="A.G. Cook" title="A.G. Cook"/>
<p>Producer, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and PC Music founder A.G. Cook shatters the boundaries between mainstream pop and experimental electronic music. In the process, he has shaped the look and sound of the 2010s and 2020s. With the PC Music label and collective, he embraced the growing role of technology in music-making, as well as the personalities of the people using that technology. The results were a slick but decidedly quirky aesthetic equally inspired by '90s Europop, K-pop, and J-pop, superstar producers such as Max Martin, and corporate branding. Working with Hannah Diamond, GFOTY, Easyfun, and other PC Music artists, Cook took pop music to sugary and abrasive extremes in the early 2010s. Later in the decade, that style edged closer to the mainstream with his work as Charli XCX's creative director, as well as in the music of hyper-pop artists such as 100 gecs and Dorian Electra, and Gen Z singer/songwriters like Clairo and Billie Eilish.</p>
<p>With PC Music, Cook took a more organized and official approach to establishing a record label that was also a creative collective of producers, songwriters, singers, and visual artists. Founded in August 2013, PC Music afforded Cook the opportunity to act as an A&R man, and artists like GFOTY, Easyfun, Princess Bambi, and Hannah Diamond soon joined the roster along with Dux Content and Cook and Harle's solo work. Cook's own debut for the label came with 2013's Nu Jack Swung EP, which featured vocalist Patricia Edwards and epitomized PC Music's bright, fragmented subversions of traditional pop tropes. In January 2014, he released the single "Keri Baby," a collaboration with Diamond that he followed with June's Eurodance-influenced "Beautiful." Cook's other projects that year included co-producing QT's single "Hey QT" with SOPHIE and "What I Mean," a track from his Personal Computer Music mix that he released as a single that December. Around that time, Cook worked on the track "Bubs" with Oneohtrix Point Never.</p>
